# Note: Strava credentials are NOT stored here
# They should be configured as Airflow Variables after setup:
#   1. Run: make credentials
#   2. Or set via UI: Admin → Variables
#   3. Or set via CLI: docker-compose exec airflow-webserver airflow variables set KEY VALUE
#
# Required Airflow Variables:
#   STRAVA_CLIENT_ID
#   STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET
#   STRAVA_REFRESH_TOKEN
#
# These are read from ../extract/.env by the create-connections.sh script

# Optional: Sentry Cloud DSN for error tracking
# Get your DSN from https://sentry.io (Project Settings > Client Keys)
